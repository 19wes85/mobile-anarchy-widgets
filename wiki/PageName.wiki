#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Introduction =

This project will host a collection of views/widgets/controls that I needed for my android projects, but I couldn't find them build into the framework.
I hope, that in time, more widgets will be added to this project.


= Current Widgets =

  * *ThreasholdEditText* - same as the "standard" EditText, but with a new _OnThresholdTextChanged_ event added to the view that will be fired after a specific (configurable) delay from the last received input.
  * *DockPanel* - retractable panel that can be docked to any one of the screen sides. A custom button will allow the hiding and revealing of the panel.


= Contribution = 

If you want to contribute by improving the existing widgets, or adding one of your own to the project, please contact me at: admin /at/ mobileanarchy.com
